# DATA 602 Final Project - Sneaker Resale Valuation

Eddie Xu

1. Research Question
What is the most valued sneaker in the after market in 2023, compared to 2019?

2. Justification - why is this relevant to you or industry?
Sneakers have been prominent in the Hip Hop Music industry for decades and now it's a cultural phenomenon. We now call those who are part of this ongoing trend "Sneakerheads." With that in mind, multi-million dollar brands such as Adidas, Nike, Reebok, and New Balance are the leading competitors and are profiting off limited edition sneakers that sell unique colors, makes, and seasonal footwear. 

3. Data Sources - did you find this data online or collect yourself? Provide links.
The data sources used for the project are coming from kaggles

- 2023 data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajiaron/stockx-sneaker-data
- 2019 data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hudsonstuck/stockx-data-contest

4. Libraries potentially being used.
- Pandas: Since the data source is from csv files, the library is needed for ETL process.
- NumPy: The library is needed since calculations will be used to determine the sneaker value
- Seaborn: The library is needed to develop data visualizations and views.
